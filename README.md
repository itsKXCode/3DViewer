# 3DViewer
 
A VTK Powered Software for visualizing common 3D Files (.obj, .ply, .stl).

## Story
The Software was made in my spare Time for the Company i was working at.\
The Company was developing a python Script which measures the Thickness of 3D Objects, but due to bad UX/UI it was nearly unable to use by an average employee without technical knowledge. So i decided to experiment with VTK (which was already used in the python script) and tried to improve the User Experience.\
\
As the Software got used more and more inside our Company we further developed the Software and more Features got added.\
\
In this Repository im trying to Rewrite a lot of the old Source Code to add it to my portfolio.\
\
Due to Company secrets im not able to put EVERYTHING in the Code the Software originally were able to do.
