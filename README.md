# 3DViewer
 
A VTK Powered Software for visualizing common 3D Files (.obj, .ply, .stl).

## Story
The software was made in my spare time for the company I was working for.
The company was developing a Python script that measures the thickness of 3D objects, but due to bad UX and UI, it was nearly impossible to be used by an average employee without technical knowledge. So I decided to experiment with VTK (which was already used in the Python script) and try to improve the user experience.

As the software got used more and more inside our company, we further developed it and added more features.

In this repository, I'm trying to rewrite a lot of the old source code to add it to my portfolio.

Due to company secrets I'm not able to put EVERYTHING in the code that the software was originally able to do.
